## Getting started with LINE Login

To start using LINE Login, you must first create a channel on the [LINE Developers console](https://developers.line.me/console/).

> ### What's a channel?
>
> To use the LINE platform, your application must be linked to a **channel**. When a channel is created, a unique **channel ID** is issued to identify the channel. Channels must have a name, description, and icon image.
