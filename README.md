# LineSDK

LineSDK is an AIR Native Extension to access the LINE platform including LINE Login.


LINE Login lets people easily create an account for your app or website using their LINE accounts. You can integrate LINE Login into your iOS, Android, or web app.

Add LINE Login to your iOS or Android app to let LINE handle the task of authenticating users. When users are logged in to LINE on their iOS or Android device, they are able to log in to your app without entering their email address and password.
